# NOT A DRAG & DROP
### Add the "customcmds.lua" file into "qb-smallresources/server"
### Add the "bring.lua" file into "qb-smallresources/client"
### Add the "en.lua" file into "qb-smallresources/locales"
(You can translate & rename the "en.lua" file to fit your server's language)

It's so easy lmao
